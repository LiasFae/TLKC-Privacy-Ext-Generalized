## Introduction
This project implements the extended version of the TLKC-privacy model proposed in the paper [TLKC-Privacy Model for Process Mining](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340261780_TLKC-Privacy_Model_for_Process_Mining).
## Python package
The implementation has been published as a standard Python package. Use the following command to install the corresponding Python package:

```shell
pip install p-tlkc-privacy-ext
```

## Usage

Check the main files in the root directory to see the usage.

## Generalization Extension
The project has been further extended with the option to use generalization instead of suppression, which is not part of the published Python package.
